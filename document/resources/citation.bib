  abstract = {Learn how to use R to turn raw data into insight, knowledge, and understanding. This book introduces you to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed to work together to make data science fast, fluent, and fun. Suitable for readers with no previous programming experience, R for Data Science is designed to get you doing data science as quickly as possible.

Authors Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund guide you through the steps of importing, wrangling, exploring, and modeling your data and communicating the results. You'll get a complete, big-picture understanding of the data science cycle, along with basic tools you need to manage the details. Each section of the book is paired with exercises to help you practice what you've learned along the way.

You'll learn how to:

    Wrangle—transform your datasets into a form convenient for analysis
    Program—learn powerful R tools for solving data problems with greater clarity and ease
    Explore—examine your data, generate hypotheses, and quickly test them
    Model—provide a low-dimensional summary that captures true "signals" in your dataset
    Communicate—learn R Markdown for integrating prose, code, and results},

abstract = {While there have been a dozen of authoring systems and programming toolkits for visual design and development, users who do not have programming skills, such as data analysts or interface designers, still may feel cumbersome to efficiently implement a web-based visualization. In this paper, we present ECharts, an open-sourced, web-based, cross-platform framework that supports the rapid construction of interactive visualization. The motivation is driven by three goals: easy-to-use, rich built-in interactions, and high performance. The kernel of ECharts is a suite of declarative visual design language that customizes built-in chart types. The underlying streaming architecture, together with a high-performance graphics renderer based on HTML5 canvas, enables the high expandability and performance of ECharts. We report the design, implementation, and applications of ECharts with a diverse variety of examples. We compare the utility and performance of ECharts with C3.js, HighCharts, and Chart.js. Results of the experiments demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our framework. Since the first release in June 2013, ECharts has iterated 63 versions, and attracted over 22,000 star counts and over 1700 related projects in the GitHub. ECharts is regarded as a leading visualization development tool in the world, and ranks the third in the GitHub visualization tab.}
